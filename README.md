# Auctions_2019_Project

The project analyzes the performance of online auctions in 2019 in the U.S. Through a dataset available on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/shaswat1/usa-online-auctions-2019) we will look for which features are most closely related to the percentage of lots sold and the price realized, as well as the geographic location of auctions and the most functional auction type.
